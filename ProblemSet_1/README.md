As always, it will help to think of a specific application. A classic example occurred when Austin, Texas undertook a study of the positioning of its emergency medical service (EMS) vehicles. That city was divided into service districts needing EMS services, and vehicle stations selected from a list of alternatives so that as much of the population as possible would experience a quick response to calls for help.
Figure shows the fictitious map we will assume for our numerical ver- sion. Our city is divided into 20 service districts that we wish to serve from some combination of the 10 indicated possibilities for EMS stations. Each station can provide service to all adjacent districts. For example, station 2 could service districts 1, 2, 6, and 7. Main decision variables are

## Problem 2

### **problem description**
 The sister communities program pairs cities in Russia with cities in the United States that have a similar size and economic base. Visits are then exchanged between the sister com- munities to improve international understanding. The following table shows the programâ€™s compatibility scores (0 to 100) for the 4 U.S. and 4 Russian cities about to join the program.<br>

 Sister communities seeks a maximum total compatibility pairing. <br>

### **Formulate Problem**

xij = 1 if U.S. city i is assigned to Russian city j <br>
xij = 0 otherwise

### **Output**

```
Objective value: 338.0
x = [-0.0 -0.0 1.0 -0.0; -0.0 1.0 -0.0 -0.0; 1.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0; -0.0 -0.0 0.0 1.0]
```
maximum compatibility = 338 <br>
X_13 = X_21 = X_31 = X_44 = 1, others = 0
